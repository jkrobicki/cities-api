## Introduction:

API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a way to programmatically interact with a separate software component or resource. When it comes to software, APIs are literally everywhere. They are a longstanding concept in computer programming, and they have been part of developers’ toolsets for years. 

The web, modern API presented in this app is using REST, running on the same infrastructure the World Wide Web runs on. This kind of API, as there are a few, was born at the beginning of 00’s and was used mainly by e-commerce -  eBay and Amazon. A bit later Facebook, Google with Google Maps and Twitter joined, developing the concept. Its true potential however was reached much later, with essential assistance of cloud backend and omnipresent mobile apps. 

## How an API works:

To understand the whole API idea imagine being in a restaurant. You sit at the table and you want to eat some delicious food made by a famous chef. The problem is you have to go to the kitchen and ask him personally what you can eat here and after that order food you have chosen. Imagine it would take a lot of yours and especially chefs time, complicating the whole process.

So here comes THE waiter (your restaurant API).   
From this moment he’ll be the messenger between you, the chef and the whole kitchen. You can ask him a question and order food, which then be given a chefs response (preparing food).
